I am currently enrolled in the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp course on Udemy — a structured learning program designed to take me from beginner to confident Python developer through consistent practice, real-world applications, and hands-on projects. This course challenges me to code every day, building useful applications and strengthening my programming fundamentals along the way.

🎯 What the Course Is About

->This course is focused on helping learners:

 ->Learn foundational and advanced Python programming concepts

 ->Build real applications such as games, automation tools, web apps, and more

 ->Improve problem-solving and coding confidence through project-based learning

 ->Apply Python to areas such as data handling, APIs, GUIs, database work, and more

 ->Follow the 100-Days-of-Code approach — writing Python code every day for 100 straight days.

📈 My Coding Action & GitHub Workflow

For this project:

->I write code daily based on what I learn from the course.

->Each piece of code — whether it’s exercises, projects, or challenges — is committed to this GitHub repository.

->This repository serves as a coding journal and portfolio that reflects my progress, learning milestones, and evolving skills.

🧠 Why I’m Doing This

I believe the best way to learn programming is by building real things, overcoming errors, and shipping code every day. This approach helps me:

->Apply concepts instead of just reading or watching videos

->Track progress and articulate growth to future reviewers

->Build confidence and a strong portfolio of Python projects
